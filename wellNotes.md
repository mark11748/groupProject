Start cell Northeast (x2,y2)
  A slight breeze blows thick dust into your nostrils and you feel the cold damp stone floor as to wake to a darkened room, but where is it?  And how did you get here?  What is the last thing you remember? Do you remember anything?  The air is dense and you are struggling to breathe.  You can make out one door to the west? But why do you know it's the west?

North (x2, y1)
  As you walk through the door, you knock over a box and examining the contents strewn across the floor, you find a working flash light that illuminates another door to the west.

Northwest (x2, y0)
  This is just another empty chamber, but as you scan the room, your light frames a strange blown up and pasted to the West wall.  Hundreds of people stare masked into the camera.  Uniformed children and adults waiting for the gas to fall.

  To the south, an open passage is obscured by a neatly stacked pile of ammo crates with a thick layer of dust.

West (x1, y0)
