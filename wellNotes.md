Some content for well readout



Start cell (x2,y2)
  A slight breeze blows thick dust into your nostrils and you feel the cold damp stone floor as to wake to a darkened room, but where is it?  And how did you get here?  What is the last thing you remember? Do you remember anything?  The air is dense and you are struggling to breathe.  You can make out one door to the west? But why do you know it's the west?

Next cell (x1, y2)
  As you walk through the door, you knock over a box and examining the contents strewn across the floor, you find a flash light and it works, illuminating another door to the west... take it with you?
